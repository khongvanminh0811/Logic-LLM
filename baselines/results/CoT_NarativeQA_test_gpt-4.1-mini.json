Since the question asks which puddle-duck puts on Tom's clothes, the best answer is Rebeccah, as she is one of the two female ducks who put on some of the dropped clothing, while Mr. Drake puts clothes on himself, not on Tom. The text does not say Jemima puts on Tom's clothes, only that Jemima and Rebeccah put on some dropped clothing. Therefore, Rebeccah is the puddle-duck who puts on Tom's clothes."

The context describes several conflicts between them, but the key \"final assault\" is when Marcus takes revenge by reporting McTeague to the authorities, resulting in McTeague being debarred from practicing dentistry. This act directly causes McTeague's downfall. Later physical fights occur, but those are confrontations, not the \"final assault\" in terms of sabotage or betrayal.
