You are given a natural language question and a set of candidate answers. Your task is to transform the question into a sentence template that can be used to evaluate each candidate answer. In the template, replace the part corresponding to the answer with the placeholder [[CANDIDATE_ANSWER]]. This placeholder will later be substituted with each candidate answer in turn.

The resulting template should preserve the meaning of the original question and be grammatically correct when [[CANDIDATE_ANSWER]] is replaced by an actual answer.

*Note: Only response the replaced sentence, do not response question.
Example:

Question:
