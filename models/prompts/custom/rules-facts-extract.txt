In logical reasoning, identifying facts and rules plays a core role in the process of analyzing and representing natural language using First-Order Logic (FOL). Facts are specific pieces of information that can be observed from the context, while rules are generalizations or broad relationships derived from facts that can be applied to various situations. In this context, we can understand premises as "facts" and conclusions as "rules."     
Known that each rules can be extract from multiple facts. Do not use any subordinating conjunctions in the implication. Replace pronouns by the appropriate nouns so that there are no pronouns. Now find the facts and rules can be extract from those facts. Remember only extract rules that contains in the context. If there are no rules can be found, left the rules empty. If there is a rule extracted, the facts should not contain that rule.

Input: 
At Madeline Hall, an old mansion-house near Southampton belonging to the wealthy de Versely family, lives an elderly spinster Miss Delmar, the aunt of the earl de Versely and Captain Delmar. Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.

Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are both severely injured. Grace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn after the accident.
