You are given a paragraph along with a set of facts and rules that have been extracted from it. Your task is to identify and extract entities from the paragraph for use in a first-order logic (FOL) structure.

Definition:
An entity can be a noun phrase, pronoun, or proper name that refers to a distinct object or concept with identifiable properties.

Guidelines:
- Answer should not have any comments or explainations, just the extracted entities
- Do not skip any sentence in the paragraph; every sentence must be considered.
- If multiple expressions refer to the same real-world object, event, or concept (e.g., synonyms, pronouns, or rephrasings), extract a single unified entity to represent them.
- If there is a group or collection of related objects or events that naturally form a single category, define a collective entity to represent the group.

The extracted entities should be organized as follows:

group name: entity1, entity2, entity3, ...
group name: entity4, entity5, ...
entity6, entity7, ... (other entities that do not belong to any group)

Notes: group should have more than 2 entities

Here are some examples of finding entities:
Context: 
At Madeline Hall, an old mansion-house near Southampton belonging to the wealthy de Versely family, lives an elderly spinster Miss Delmar, the aunt of the earl de Versely and Captain Delmar. Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.

Teenager Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) go out early one winter's morning to ride their horses, Pilgrim and Gulliver. As they ride up an icy slope, Gulliver slips and hits Pilgrim. Both horses fall, dragging the girls onto a road and colliding with a truck. Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are both severely injured. Grace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn after the accident.
